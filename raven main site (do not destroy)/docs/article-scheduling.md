# Article Scheduling Feature Documentation

## Overview

The article scheduling feature allows administrators to schedule articles for future publication rather than publishing them immediately. This enhances content management capabilities by enabling planned content releases without manual intervention.

## Features Implemented

1. **Schedule Toggle**
   - Added checkbox to toggle between immediate publishing and scheduled publishing
   - Visual indication of scheduling status in the admin interface

2. **Date Selection**
   - Date picker appears when scheduling is enabled
   - Enforces future dates only (cannot schedule in the past)
   - Date format standardization for consistent storage

3. **Status Tracking**
   - Added status property to articles: `published` or `scheduled`
   - Visual status indicators with appropriate colors:
     - Published: Green
     - Scheduled: Amber/Yellow

4. **Admin UI Enhancements**
   - Updated post creation form with scheduling options
   - Dynamic button text that changes based on action (Publish/Schedule)
   - Status badges in the post listing

5. **Post Management**
   - Articles can be created with immediate publication or scheduled for future dates
   - Scheduled articles remain in the system but aren't visible to users until publication date

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

The post state model has been extended with:
```javascript
{
  // Existing fields
  title: '',
  content: '',
  imageUrl: '',
  
  // New scheduling fields
  scheduleDate: '',    // ISO date string for publication
  isScheduled: false,  // Toggle for scheduled status
  status: ''           // 'published' or 'scheduled'
}
```

### Admin Interface

The PostsTab component has been enhanced with:
- Scheduling toggle checkbox
- Conditional date picker field
- Status indicators for post listings
- Updated form submission logic

### Publication Logic

When creating a post:
1. If scheduling is disabled, the post is immediately published with current date
2. If scheduling is enabled, the post is marked as scheduled with the future publication date
3. Status is set appropriately for display in the admin dashboard

## Usage Guide

### Creating a Scheduled Post

1. Navigate to the admin dashboard
2. Click "Create New Post"
3. Fill in post details (title, content, image URL)
4. Check "Schedule for later"
5. Select the desired publication date
6. Click "Schedule Post"

### Managing Scheduled Posts

In the post listing:
- Published posts display a green "Published" badge
- Scheduled posts display an amber "Scheduled" badge with the scheduled publication date
- Both types can be deleted using the delete button

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Automated Publishing**
   - Background job to automatically publish scheduled articles when their date arrives
   - Notification system to alert when scheduled articles are published

2. **Schedule Editing**
   - Ability to modify the scheduled date of already scheduled articles
   - Rescheduling options for published articles

3. **Scheduling Analytics**
   - Calendar view of scheduled posts
   - Publication timeline visualization

4. **Advanced Scheduling**
   - Time-based scheduling (not just date)
   - Recurring publication schedules
   - Publication workflow with approval steps
