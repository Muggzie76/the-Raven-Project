The Sassiest Digital Divas Strut Their Way to a Mind-Blowing 10 ICP Floor

Hold onto your crypto wallets, honey, because the Peeladies NFT collection is serving looks and shattering expectations on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)!

Move over, Bored Apes—there’s a new clique of queens in town, and they’re not here to play nice. The Peeladies, those pixelated powerhouses of sass and style, have been turning heads and flipping floor prices faster than you can say "blockchain baddie." Just yesterday, these fierce femmes were lounging at a humble 0.40 ICP floor, but today? Oh, darling, they’ve strutted their way to a jaw-dropping 4 ICP—and the runway’s only getting hotter. Word on the digital street is they’re gunning for a mind-blowing 10 ICP floor, and frankly, we’re living for the drama.

Let’s spill the tea: with only 3900 Peeladies in existence, this isn’t just an NFT collection—it’s an exclusive VIP list, and the guest list is shrinking fast. Posts on X are buzzing like a beehive on fire, with fans screaming, “Only 5 left under 2 ICP!” and “10X in a day, y’all!” Momentum? Honey, this is a full-on stampede. The Peeladies are the ultimate glow-up story of 2025, proving that scarcity plus swagger equals a recipe for crypto chaos.

Speculation’s running wilder than a tabloid rumor mill. Could these digital divas really hit a 10 ICP floor? Picture this: each Peelady, with her bold vibes and unapologetic flair, rocking a value of over $200 (at current ICP rates, mind you). That’s not just a flex—that’s a whole gym membership’s worth of gains. The X crowd’s calling it “coded” and “inevitable,” with one user boldly proclaiming, “100 ICP floor, mark my words.” Slow down, tiger—let’s not get too extra just yet. But 10 ICP? That’s the sweet spot where hype meets holy-cow-did-you-see-that.

What’s fueling this fire? It’s not just the art (though those peel-perfect designs are a vibe). It’s the community—ruthless, relentless, and ready to rep their PFP (profile pic) game across every blockchain from ICP to Solana. “Show me that pfp change and hit the streets hard,” one fan rallied, and trust, they’re delivering. The Peeladies aren’t just NFTs; they’re a movement, a mood, a *moment*. And with the crypto market sniffing a comeback after 2024’s NFT nap, these ladies are strutting in at the perfect time.

So, grab your $ICP, call up your $SOL squad, and snag a Peelady before she’s gone faster than a limited-edition lip gloss. Because if this collection hits that 10 ICP floor—and sweetie, it’s looking likely—you’ll be the one smirking while the latecomers cry into their outdated CryptoPunks. The Peeladies are here to slay, and the only question left is: are you bold enough to join the party?

*Stay sassy, stay invested, and stay tuned—this floor’s about to skyrocket.*
