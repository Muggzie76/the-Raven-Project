$1.5 Billion GONE!
Hold onto your wallets, crypto fam, because Bybit, that oh-so-fancy Dubai-based exchange, just got *humiliated* in the most expensive way possible. On February 21, 2025, some sneaky hackers waltzed right into one of Bybit‚Äôs ‚Äúsuper secure‚Äù offline Ethereum wallets and snatched a cool $1.4 to $1.5 BILLION in digital goodies.
Ethereum, stETH, mETH‚Äîyou name it, they took it. Apparently, these cyber geniuses pulled off a social engineering stunt so slick, they tricked wallet signers into signing a malicious smart contract like it was a VIP guest list. Blind signing? More like blind robbery, honey.
Cue Bybit‚Äôs CEO Ben Zhou stepping into the spotlight, all ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre fine!‚Äù Sure, babe, you‚Äôre fine after losing 9% of your $16.2 billion stash‚Äîmath checks out. He‚Äôs swearing up and down that client funds are ‚Äú1:1 backed‚Äù and that Bybit‚Äôs got enough pocket change (or, uh, bridge loans from their rich friends) to cover this little oopsie. They‚Äôve even ‚Äúsecured‚Äù 80% of the stolen ETH already. Secured how? Magic? A sternly worded email? We‚Äôre dying to know. Meanwhile, withdrawals are piling up faster than a Black Friday sale, so good luck getting your cash out anytime soon.
Oh, and plot twist: the crypto cops at Elliptic and Arkham Intelligence are pointing fingers at North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group. Yep, those shady legends are back, probably sipping champagne with 401,347 ETH in their offshore piggy bank. The market? Freaking out, obvi‚ÄîEthereum tanked over 5%, Bitcoin stumbled 3%, and everyone‚Äôs clutching their pearls.
So, here we are, February 22, 2025, watching Bybit sweat while the internet drags them for thinking cold wallets were hacker-proof. Spoiler: they‚Äôre not. Stay sassy, stay suspicious, and maybe double-check your own crypto stash, because if Bybit can get played this hard, no one‚Äôs safe. XOXO, your breaking news tea-spiller.
