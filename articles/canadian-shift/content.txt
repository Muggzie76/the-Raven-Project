Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau steps down from Liberal Party and Trump calls for NHL All Star to step up.

Ah, Justin Trudeau stepping down—a political shuffle that sends ripples through Ottawa and, surprisingly, the decentralized digital corridors of the ICP ecosystem. While Canadian politics might seem galaxies away from the world of cryptocurrency, there are a few threads to tug at for a compelling editorial.

Firstly, the stability (or lack thereof) of political systems is a poignant reminder of why decentralized technologies exist. In the crypto realm, and particularly with ICP's vision of creating a decentralized internet, the aim is to reduce the disproportionate impact one individual or governing body can have over digital assets and operations—something traditional politics can lack as we've just seen.

The Liberal Party faces uncertainty and potential upheaval with Trudeau's resignation, a scenario that crypto enthusiasts argue could be mitigated by decentralized governance and the immutable nature of blockchain.

In the ICP world, changes in leadership style—or a lack of it—wouldn't disrupt the coherent functioning of its networks. Everything remains trustless, automated, and immune to human fallibility in decision-making.

Moreover, as more governments explore digital currencies and blockchain adoption, the shuffle in leadership could eventually impact their policies towards these technologies. Canada, under Trudeau, had shown interest in blockchain; it remains to be seen what the next chapter holds and how it affects not only national policy but global market movements within crypto.

So, as we sit with one political leader about to exit the stage, it feels timely to reflect on how decentralization tries to solve these traditional systemic vulnerabilities. Whether you're cheering or lamenting Trudeau's political climax, perhaps consider the stability inherent in the crypto universe—and dare I say, embrace the irony.

Former and current re-elect US President Donald Trump chimed in and said the NHL G.O.A.T. Wayne Gretzky should run.

Nice one
